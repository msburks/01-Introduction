# 01-Introduction

The code I have written is in attempt to shine a light on who I am as an invididual.

I have answered the questions provided in hopes that whomever is reading this may gain a little insight into my likes, fears, and hope about this class specifically, and about my intentions going forward with game design.

If someone reading this has any additional questions for me, I would gladly recieve those questions and write up new code in hopes of answering them effectively.

Enjoy!
